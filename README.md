of the application is an n-tier structured MVC utilizing the Data, Models, Services and WebMVC.  
## User Story  
This project was inspired by the small studio where I study Pilates.  The owner kept hand written notes on what was done in the class and what to do in the future. Notes and information on the session is nice to have but the third part of this applicaiton is the addition of what equipment was utilized 
during the session. This application allows the the owner to keep track of the client information in one spot!
